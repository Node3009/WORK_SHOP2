Travis-CI integration:
1- I logged into the site https://travis-ci.com/ using my GitHup account
2- I have allowed access to all my repositry in GitHub by travis-CI
3- I wrote the yml file and added it to my repository, on which I want to activate releases tests
4- then the activation was done between the project repositry and travis

issues:
1- i encountered many problems connecting repositories in gitHup with the tool
2- I had a problem writing the yml file as it doesn't work on new versions of NodeJs
